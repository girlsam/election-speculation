## Unit 1 Project

#### Speculation 2016

The goal of this project was to take away all the noise surrounding the 2016 presidential election and replace it with real-time numbers.

To accomplish this distillation of data, I sought to create an interactive application that aggregates polling data from each state and displays this data on a choropleth map. The API powering this data is called PollyVote, which provides evidence-based election forecasting. It utilizes Leaflet Javascript library and GeoJSON data which is layered over a customized, Mapbox map.
